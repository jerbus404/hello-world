    <h2>First person shooter in microsoft paint.</h2>
    <pre>
Warning: This is a pretty stupid project, and i am <u>Very</u> underqualified to be 
doing it because I have absolutely zero understanding of 3d rendering.

I got this idea when I was playing around in microsoft paint, and I discovered that
you could use the arrow keys to move around the selected pixels. I drew a little smiley
face and a simple maze, and maneuvered the little face to the end. This was by no means a
functional game, but it got me wondering...
Is it possible to program a game in microsoft paint?

The answer is obviously no. 
Microsoft paint is not a programming language, and it has nothing that would
let it directly interact with code.
But Python has a library that lets you simulate mouse and keyboard input.
so, theoretically, you could use the mouse to draw the game once per frame.
It turns out that drawing any sufficiently complex picture using the mouse more than once
every few seconds is incredibly slow, and causes visual glitches and crashing in ms paint.
I'm currently working on a solution, or at least a less buggy way of drawing lots of things
quickly.

I'm using the libraries mouse and keyboard, which are small libraries that work really well.
I think the issue is that ms paint isn't used to people moving their mouse faster than
the speed of light, so it doesnt render the lines properly, or sometimes just crashes.
